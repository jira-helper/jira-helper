# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Jira's native grouping and progress tracking are limited, especially for teams with custom workflows. This project provides advanced grouping and visualization features to improve project management.

## Problems it solves
- Lack of flexible custom groupings (by field or JQL).
- No visual badge counters for custom groups.
- Difficulty tracking sub-task progress across custom-defined groups.
- Inconsistent or case-sensitive field matching in JQL.

## How it should work
- Users can define custom groups using either field values or JQL.
- The UI allows configuration of group names, colors, and display modes (counter or bar).
- Progress and counters update in real time as issues and sub-tasks change.
- All matching is robust to case and array values.

## User experience goals
- Simple, intuitive group configuration.
- Immediate visual feedback on board.
- Reliable, predictable group matching and progress display.
