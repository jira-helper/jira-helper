# Progress

## What works
- Custom group configuration UI (field and JQL modes).
- Badge counter and progress bar display for groups.
- JQL parser and matcher with case-insensitive, array-aware logic.
- Unit tests for all major matching scenarios.

## What's left to build
- Further UI/UX improvements for group management.
- More advanced JQL features if needed.
- Additional integration with Jira board data as requirements evolve.

## Current status
- Core features are implemented and tested.
- All current unit tests pass after recent logic updates.

## Known issues
- Edge cases in JQL parsing may arise as new requirements/tests are added.
- UI may need further refinement for large boards or many custom groups.
