## Storybook and Component Architecture Pattern

- All components used in Storybook must be pure (UI-only, no DI, no side effects).
- Container components are responsible for connecting pure components to application logic, dependency injection, and data fetching.
- This separation ensures that Storybook stories are isolated, reliable, and do not require application context or providers.
- When adding a new component, always create a pure version for Storybook and a container version for use in the application if the component needs DI or side effects.
