## Card Colors

Jira has a built-in feature for highlighting cards on the board with colors based on JQL queries. However, this highlighting is limited to a thin strip on the left edge of the card. The Card Colors feature enhances this by applying the highlight to the entire card instead of just the left strip.

Examples:

Base Jira:

![Before](../assets/card-colors-before.jpg)

Jira with Jira Helper:

![After](../assets/card-colors-after.jpg)

To enable or disable this feature, go to the board settings screen => Card Colors, where you can adjust the settings for this functionality.
